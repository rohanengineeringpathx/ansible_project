🚀 Ansible + AWS EC2 + Docker + Nginx Deployment
This project showcases a fully automated deployment pipeline using AWS EC2, Docker, and Nginx to serve a custom HTML landing page — all built and deployed by me 😎.

From spinning up the infrastructure to launching the application, everything was done using modern DevOps techniques and cloud-native tools.

⚙️ What I Did (Step-by-Step)
✅ Provisioned an EC2 instance on AWS
✅ Configured Security Groups to open ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP)
✅ SSH’d into the instance using a .pem key
✅ Installed Docker to handle container deployment
✅ Deployed an Nginx container that serves a beautiful custom index.html landing page
✅ Verified deployment with a live public IP

No load balancers. No EC2 AMI images. Just pure command-line power and container magic.
